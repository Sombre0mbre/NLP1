In this project, we built a sentiment classifier on the IMDB sentiment dataset.
We tested differents models to improve our accuracy :
- In the 02/ directory we used a Naive Bayes
- In the 03/ directory we used the Fasttext model
- In the 04/ directory we used an RNN and LSTM
- In the 05/ directory we use Transformers to translate sentences
- In the 06/ directory we have use finetunning for classificaiton
- In the 07/ directory we have done a semantic search with/without neighbors
